# motion-breakout

A kinda Antari Breakout clone that uses GY521 gyroscope as the controller

I was learning pyGame when I found this breakout clone was one of the example projects so I
just added motion control to it

Sick name, eh gameplay, bruh graphic


edit: I found the original project! https://www.pygame.org/project/1832/3207
